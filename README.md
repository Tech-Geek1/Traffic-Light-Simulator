Group Staryu: PRL2 Traffic Optimizer

To run the code you need to run Engine.java. This starts the application. Once the application is running an input box appears that allows you to input variables that will update the GUI. You can toggle on the optimizer which displays a heat map to see where traffic is heaviest.
